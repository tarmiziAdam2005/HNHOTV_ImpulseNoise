1. Introduction

-This is a simple document on how to run denoising(codes can also be used for deblurring) experiments on images corrupted with Salt-and-Pepper, random valued impulse noise.

2. Instructions

-Make sure all the related ".m" files are in one folder. The main solver for HNHOTV-OGS algoritm is "HNHOTV_OGS_Impulse.m". Inside the main solver, the overlapping group sparse (OGS) solver "gstvdm.m" is called.

To start a simple denoising demo, run the matlab script "DemoImpulse.m".
